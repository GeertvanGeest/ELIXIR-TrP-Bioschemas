## Bioschemas profiles for training resources

[add-bioschemas file='docs/training-material.yaml']

Many training related resources will include pages describing tutorials or courses. As such, they are marked up using the following three profiles:

- `TrainingMaterial`: A profile describing training materials in life sciences, it can be used on its own (as it happens with the Bioschemas tutorials) or in combination with a `CourseInstance`.
- `Course`: A profile describing a course from a generic point of view, i.e., the learning objectives of a course rather than where and when it is delivered.
- `CourseInstance`: A profile describing a particular instance of a course, i.e., an edition of a course that is scheduled for specific dates and happening in a specific location (that of course can be online or on-site, virtual or real).

Note that the `CourseInstance` profile is used in tandem with the `Course` profile, i.e., a `CourseInstance` does not exist without a `Course` but a `Course` can exist without a `CourseInstance` (there are no current offerings of the course).
