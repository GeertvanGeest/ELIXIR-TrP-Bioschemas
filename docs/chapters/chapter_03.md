## Introduction

In this example, we use the ELIXIR Lesson template since it uses mkdocs as static site generator and comes with a Python library [addbioschemas](https://pypi.org/project/addbioschemas/) which makes adding Bioschemas markup quite easy.
For the ELIXIR Lesson template, an extensive tutorial has been [published](https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-LessonTemplateInstructions-MkDocs/) which describes Bioschemas markup using addbioschemas.

## Bioschemas profiles for training resources

Many training related resources will include pages describing tutorials or courses. As such, they are marked up using the following three profiles:

- `TrainingMaterial`: A profile describing training materials in life sciences, it can be used on its own (as it happens with the Bioschemas tutorials) or in combination with a `CourseInstance`.
- `Course`: A profile describing a course from a generic point of view, i.e., the learning objectives of a course rather than where and when it is delivered.
- `CourseInstance`: A profile describing a particular instance of a course, i.e., an edition of a course that is scheduled for specific dates and happening in a specific location (that of course can be online or on-site, virtual or real).

Note that the `CourseInstance` profile is used in tandem with the `Course` profile, i.e., a `CourseInstance` does not exist without a `Course` but a `Course` can exist without a `CourseInstance` (there are no current offerings of the course).

## Setup of the repository

Let's start with the first step and create a new repository from the [Bioschemas tutorial template for mkdocs](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-TrP-Bioschemas-MkDocs-Template). Once you have opened the link in your browser, you can create a new github repository by clicking on the green 'Use template' button.
Enter a new name for the created repository e.g. ELIXIR-TrP-Bioschemas-mkdocs under your own GitHub account.

## Markup for a training course page using mkdocs as static site generator

We reuse the technical [instruction](https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-LessonTemplateInstructions-MkDocs/chapters/chapter_02/#adding-bioschemas-markup) given in the ELIXIR Lesson template tutorial to add markup using the libray addbioschemas. But instead of using an annotation according to Bioschemas profile `LearningResource` we start with the profiles `Course/CourseInstance`.

Open the file `_data/metadata.yml` and add the following:

```yaml
"@context": https://schema.org/
"@type": Course
"@id": https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-LessonTemplate-MkDocs/
http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo:
  "@type": CreativeWork

  ]
hasCourseInstance:
- "@type": CourseInstance
  courseMode: online
  location: Virtual
  startDate: 2022-01-10
  endDate: 2022-01-10

  instructor:
  - "@type": Person
    name: Elin Kronander
    identifier: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0280-6318
```

The rather elaborate annotation according to Bioschemas profiles `Course/CourseInstance` which will be created by the bioschemas library looks like this.

```json
{
   "@context":"https://schema.org/",
   "@type":"Course",
  "http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo":{
    "@type":"CreativeWork",

          "name":"Alban Gaignard",
          "@id":"https://bioschemas.org/people/AlbanGaignard",
          "url":"https://bioschemas.org/people/AlbanGaignard"
        },{

        },{
          "@type":"Person",

          "@id":"https://bioschemas.org/people/AlasdairGray",

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Markup for a training material page using mkdocs as static site generator

We reuse the technical [instruction](https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-LessonTemplateInstructions-MkDocs/chapters/chapter_02/#adding-bioschemas-markup) given in the ELIXIR Lesson template tutorial to add markup using the libray addbioschemas. 
In this example, we use an annotation according to Bioschemas profile `LearningResource`.

We will use a [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file to specify the markup using the Bioschemas profile. In order to have the tutorial marked up with the Bioschemas annotation, it is important to add a specific instruction to the markdown file which contains the [initial version of the tutorial file](docs/chapters/chapter_01.md).

In combination with mkdocs-material, this specific instruction should be placed after markdown text, so never at the very top of the page.

```markdown
## 1.1 First subtopic

[add-bioschemas file='_data/training-material.yml']

Here you can enter text and create inline citations[@Garcia2020] by using the bibtex plugin. Add your references in `references.bib`, and cite [@hoebelheinrich_nancy_j_2022_6769695] by adding the @refid inside brackets like this `[@10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113]`
...
```

Create a file `_data/training-material.yml` and add the following yaml:

```yaml
"@context": https://schema.org/
"@type": LearningResource
"@id": https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-LessonTemplate-MkDocs/
http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo:

```

This `YAML` file is processed by the bioschemas library to embed the following JSON-LD within the created tutorial web page. The rather elaborate annotation according to Bioschemas profile `TrainingMaterial` looks like this:

```json
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org/",
  "@type":"LearningResource",
  "@id": "https://example.com/training-material/12345",
  "dct:conformsTo":{
    "@type":"CreativeWork",

  },

      "url":"https://bioschemas.org/people/NiallBeard"
    }
  ],
  "educationalLevel":"beginner",
  "identifier": "http://dx.doi.org/12349302",
  "inLanguage": "en-UK",
  "teaches": [
  "The student will be able to list the main Bioschemas profiles", 
  "The student will be able to write Bioschemas markup"
  ],
  "dateModified":"2021-07-22",
  "license":"CC-BY 4.0",
  "version":2.0
  }
```

This examples uses most of the properties specified in the Bioschemas profile [TrainingMaterial](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/TrainingMaterial/1.0-RELEASE). 

Once you have inserted the special instruction, save the markdown file file.

## Publish training course and material via GitHub

Start the publishing process by following these [instructions](https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-LessonTemplateInstructions-MkDocs/chapters/chapter_01/).

TODO: add specific instructions for this forked template.

## Validate the markup of the page with the Schema.org validator

Validate the individual page with the [schema.org validator](https://validator.schema.org/) by pasting the URL into the Fetch URL tab. The validation procedure will indicate if you have used non-existing properties of the Bioschemas profile. If error messages are returned, have a look at the troubleshooting section below.

In this scenario, you can validate the course web site (TODO: add link) and individual tutorial web site (TODO: add link).
